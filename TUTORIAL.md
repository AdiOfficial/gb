:tada: GB: A Galactic Bloodshed (and others) inspired 4x game for mobile :tada:

## Overview

Andromeda Rising, aka Galactic Bloodshed, is a turn-based strategy game. As the leader of your
race you manage your planet, build ships, eXplore your star sytem, eXpand to nearby systems, eXploit
any resources you find, and eXterminate anyone in your way (4X).

This game is in internal release only and has limited game play at this point. 
Please do not install if you don't want to be an early tester.

Current focus in on _enabling_ functionality, not limiting, so you play in _God Mode_ which lets
you see everything, build unlimited ships, etc. Eventually, your expansion will be constraint.

## Tutorial

# UX Navigation

* Double click on stars, planets and ships should pan and zoom to the target. Double click on empty space should zoom out
* Single click on stars, planets, and ships should bring up the details window. Single click on empty space should close it.
* Drag, pinch-zoom and double-click-drag should pan and zoom the map.

# Mission 1 - Secure your Star System
* Click on Map - the map will show you your home planet (possibly named "Helle")
* Pinch zoom out to see your home system "Jade" and a few other planets. 
* Single click on planet to open planet detail window
* Click on "Make Factory" to order a factory. 

**Note:** The game is turn based, so nothing happens yet. You first need to end your turn

* Click on "Do" to finish the turn. You see factory pop up on your home planet.
* Zoom into your home planet and click on the factory
* Make 5 pods and 1 cruiser
* "Do"
* Click on each ship in turn and set the pods destination to the other planets in your system.
* Mission Success: Population on all planets. Armed ships (i.e. Cruiser) on all planets

# Mission 2 - Explore another system
* Make a cruiser and send it to the closest system
* Follow up with a few pods.

# God Mode Fun Stuff
* On the home screen, click on "Start Other Races" (or similar). This will put three more races in play
* Click on "Cont". This will start automated turns. It's like fast-forward until you hit "Cont" again.
You can leave it on and switch to the map and see what happens. Zoom all the way out to see other races ships
exploring. Beware of the beetles. 
* Send cruisers to some of the other systems, or wait for the beetles to arrive. The cruisers will shoot down 
pods (or enemy cruisers) if they are in reach.
