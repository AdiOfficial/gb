:tada: GB: A Galactic Bloodshed (and others) inspired 4x game for mobile :tada:

This tutorial is at: https://github.com/perrochon/gb/blob/master/TUTORIAL.md

## Overview

Andromeda Rising, aka Galactic Bloodshed, is a turn-based strategy game. As the leader of your
race you manage your planet, build ships, eXplore your star sytem, eXpand to nearby systems, eXploit
any resources you find, and eXterminate anyone in your way (4X).

This game is in internal release only and has limited game play at this point. 
Please do not install if you don't want to be an early tester.

Current focus in on _enabling_ functionality, not limiting, so you play in _God Mode_ which lets
you see everything, build unlimited ships, etc. Eventually, your expansion will be constraint.

## Tutorial

# UX Navigation

* Double click on stars, planets and ships pans and zooms to the target. Double click on empty space zooms out.
* Single click on stars, planets, and ships brings up the details window. Single click on empty space closes it.
* Drag, pinch-zoom and double-click-drag pans and zooms the map.
* Double click on a planet pins the planet in a "geo-centric" view. Everything will now move around the plannet. 
  Double click on a star, or zoom out to go back to regular heliocentric mode.

# Mission 1 - Secure your Star System
* Click on Map - the map will show you your home planet (possibly named "Helle")
* Pinch zoom out to see your home system "Jade" and a few other planets. 
* Single click on planet to open planet detail window
* Click on "Make Factory" to order a factory. 

**Note:** The game is turn based, so nothing happens at this point. You first need to end your turn

* Click on "Do" to finish the turn. You see factory pop up on your home planet.
* Zoom into your home planet and click on the factory
* Make 5 pods and 1 cruiser
* "Do"
* Click on each ship in turn and set the pods destination to the other planets in your system.
* Mission Success: Population on all planets. Armed ships (i.e. Cruiser) on all planets

# Mission 2 - Explore another system
* Make a cruiser and send it to the closest system
* Follow up with a few pods.

# God Mode Fun Stuff
* On the home screen, click on "Start Other Races" (or similar). This will put three more races in play
* Click on "Cont". This will start automated turns. It's like fast-forward until you hit "Cont" again.
You can leave it on and switch to the map and see what happens. Zoom all the way out to see other races ships
exploring. Beware of the beetles. 
* Send cruisers to some of the other systems, or wait for the beetles to arrive. The cruisers will shoot down 
pods (or enemy cruisers) if they are in reach.

#FAQ

*Why can't I shoot at ships passing through a star system? Ships not entering/leaving a system are either way above
or below in the galactic planet. It may look like they fly through the system, but they are way above. One way to tell
if a Pod is in-system is to watch it's trail. If it's straight, it may be heading elsewhere. If it curves toward a planet
then it's in-system. Another way to tell is by looking closely at the color. Deep space ships are more muted than in-system.
