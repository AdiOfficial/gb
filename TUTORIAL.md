:tada: GB: A Galactic Bloodshed (and others) inspired 4x game for mobile :tada:

## Overview

Andromeda Rising, aka Galactic Bloodshed is a turn-based strategy game. As the leader of your
race you manage your planet, build ships, eXplore your star sytem, eXpand to nearby systems, eXploit
any resources you find, and eXterminate anyone in your way (4X).

This game is in internal release only and has limited game play at this point. 
Please do not install if you don't want to be an early tester.

Current focus in on _enabling_ functionality, not limiting, so you play in _God Mode_ which lets
you see everything, build unlimited ships, etc. Eventually, your expansion will be constraint.
