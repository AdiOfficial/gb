TileMap Notes

Now manually inflating the view, to better understand what happens, still getting

Commenting out implementation 'com.qozix:tileview:3.0.1' leads to compiler errors (Unresolved reference)
Commenting out implementation 'com.jakewharton:disklrucache:2.0.2' in feature compiles, then we get same error. I am
pretty sure that tileview has it as a dependency and gradle takes care of it.
Changing implementation 'com.qozix:tileview:3.0.1' to implementation 'com.qozix:tileview:3.0.2' creates an error, so
there is something right happening wiht that include

Roadmap
*******

Features
-Mission 1
    -fly and land pods
-Visibility and God Mode Switch

Code Quality
- Fix Branches!
- Universe solution, so we no longer pass universes around... and figure out how to test... No more ship creation...
- Test missions
- Pass around "context" from button. Don't use ID
- Make Location Object. Should handle stars, too.
- Access and visibility in gblib
- Use Application for global state in Android: https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Application
- Debug buffer and Console Buffer

Planet
- multiple races per planet
- Environment and impact on breeding
- Resources. Money, other.

Systems
- Planet locations, render, and movement

Universe
- Statistics on population, etc.

Races

Units
- Pods
- Planetary units
- Ships

Interactivity
- launch pods
- land battle (can do this for morphs with pods only)
- build ships
- move ships
- ship battle

Frontend
- Swipes for planets
- Cut more star background images, and rotate them through the views
- Handle killed process. Need to persist Universe?
- Run GBTest on phone (text based)
// Dealing with Killed applications, and destroyed activities...

2018-11-16
Released .76 Bunch of bug fixes and small improvements. Added basic Race View Activity with a picture of an Impi

2018-11-15
Fully Migrating Java to Kotlin. Cleaning up lots of stuff while at it, like moving static data into GBData. Migration
broke badly, and it was not clean with race allocation to sector, so commented out right now.

2018-11-14
Single planet view and colonize (through teleportation! saves implementing ships). Now have minimal "colonize the
universe functionality". Code is in bad shape, so starting to clean up. Don't want to add more functionality this way.
Need to refactor, and planning to switch everything to Kotlin. GDrive installs on all my phones broke, but work on other
phones. Not clear why.

2018-11-13
Android Studio couldn't write settings anymore. Couldn't restart. Windows reboot failed with Bitlock error. Recovery
took only the morning, mostly because it came back and I don't really know why.
Also fixed z coordinates in main, and text colors. More readable and vivid now, but not ideal
Third activity StarsView which required updating the gblib with star coordinates and an algo to distribute stars

2018-11-12
Creating second activity to deal with planets so we can have a ScrollView of planets

2018-11-11
Working on rendering one hard coded planet

2018-11-10
More refactoring. Two races. Buttons!

2018-11-09
Scrollable TextView in App displays output of text. Refactored classes out of a single file into multiple.

2018-11-08
Started this Log. Finally Enabled Hyper-V. It's under "Security" in the BIOS! Emulator is now running faster.
