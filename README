GB: A Galactic Bloodshed inspired 4x game.

:tada: blah

Directories

gblib: contains all the game logic.
app: (Android) frontend.

The rest are various Android Studio files. Not sure yet what they all do :-)

There remains lots to do here to make this better code, from tests to thread safety.
Much more to make it a better app, from accessibility to responsiveness to localization
But the initial focus is on learning Android, Kotlin, and adding functionality, so those have to wait until we
actually have an app worth releasing.
