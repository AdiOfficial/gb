    <string name="m1n0">[Y] Commander! My name is Yonininji. I will be helping your with your missions. All my hints are
        marked with [Y] at the beginning.
    </string>
    <string name="m1n1">[Y] Your first mission is to colonize your home system Jade. You can find your home planet Helle by
        clicking on the [Planets] button on the right. Once there, click on [Make Factory] to order your first factory.
        Then press the [Do] button in the lower right to have your orders executed. Nothing happens unless you press
        [Do]
    </string>
    <string name="m1n2">[Y] Congratulations! You built your first factory! Next, you have to build a pod. Click on
        [Ships] and then [Make Pod] in the factory screen. Remember to press Do after you give the order.
    </string>
    <string name="m1n3">[Y] Commander, we have a pod! Click on [Ships], swipe until you find the pod, then set a
        destination by selecting the target planet from the drop down menu and then clicking [Fly To]. Again, press [DO]
    </string>
    <string name="m1n4">[Y] A pot inflight will fly to the target on it\'s own. It\'s speed
        is 1, which allows it to reach anything else in the system in less than 20 turns. Keep hitting [Do],
        and watch any ships make progress in the [Starmap]. Order more pods and send one to each planet in your home system.
    </string>
    <string name="m1n5">[Y] Pods automatically unload their passenger alive (if you are
        lucky). It\'s a small step for a Xenos, and a big step for Xenosity.
    </string>
    <string name="m1n6">You have finished all missions. Feel free to continue to exploit the universe.</string>
