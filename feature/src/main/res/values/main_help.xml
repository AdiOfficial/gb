        <b>Mission 1 - Secure Your Star System</b>

        <ul>
            <li>Click on Map - the map will show you your home planet</li>

            <li>Pinch zoom out to see your home system and a few other planets.</li>

            <li>Single click on planet to open planet detail window</li>

            <li>Click on "Make Factory" to order a factory.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong>
            The game is turn based, so nothing happens at this point. You first need to end your turn
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Click on "Do" to finish the turn. You see factory pop up on your home planet.</li>

            <li>Zoom into your home planet and click on the factory</li>

            <li>Make 5 pods and 1 cruiser and "Do"</li>

            <li>Click on each ship in turn and set the pods destination to the other planets in your system. You need to
                select a destination in the dropdown.
            </li>

            <li>Mission Success: Population on all planets. Armed ships (i.e. cruiser) around all planets.</li>
        </ul>

        <b>Mission 2 - Explore Next System</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Zoom out all the way. By now, you should see other ships from other races. They are not friendly.</li>

            <li>Make cruisers and send them to the closest system as defense. The cruisers will shoot down pods and
                enemy cruisers if they are in reach.
            </li>

            <li>Follow up with a few pods and start populating another stat system. Once you have population on a
                planet, you can build a factory there and build cruisers locally.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <big>FAQ</big>
        <ul>
            <li>What about feature X?
                <br>
                Check out the
                <A href="https://github.com/perrochon/gb/blob/master/ROADMAP.md">road map</a>
            </li>

            <li>Why don\'t my ships shoot at enemy ships passing through a star system?
                <br>
                It may look like they fly through the system, but they are way above or below in the galactic planet.
                One way to tell if a Pod is in-system is to watch it\'s trail. If it\'s straight, it may be heading
                elsewhere. If it curves toward a planet then it\'s in-system. Another way to tell is by looking closely
                at the color. Deep space ships are more muted than in-system.
            </li>

            <li>What are the circles around some ships?
                <br>
                An experimental feature shows click targets. If it has a circle, you can click it. You can toggle this
                in options (Show Click Targets)
            </li>

            <li>What\'s up with the graphics?
                <br>
                All graphics assets are currently place holders. The ship and race pictures have been drawn by a local
                aspiring artist. If you are a graphics designer and have cycles to spare, feel free to reach out to me.
            </li>

            <li>What is the background
                <br>
                The background is <a href="https://spacetelescope.org/images/heic0601a/">Hubble\'s picture of the
                Orion Nebula.</a> Hubble took pictures of Andromeda, too. But Orion is more dramatic.
            </li>

            <li>Why is there a GB on some screens?
                <br>
                It\'s a reference to Galactic Bloodshed, an 80/90 online multi-user 4X space themed game.
            </li>
